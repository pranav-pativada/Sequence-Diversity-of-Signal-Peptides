# Visualising Sequence Diversity of Signal Peptides using t-SNE
t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) is a common machine learning technique that is used in bioinformatics to show local structural relationships. We use the t-SNE approach to generate a library of maximally diverse signal peptides for use in optimising recombinant protein secretion under the MoClo Golden Gate Cloning toolbox. For this project, we focus on extracting diverse signal peptides from the *Bacillus* genus.
